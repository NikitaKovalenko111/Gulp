# Gulp
My gulp package to work better.

Commands:

`npm run build` - run gulp in build mode.

`npm run dev` - run gulp in develope mode.

`npm run zip` - get zip archive of production folder.

`npm run deploy` - post your production folder to ftp server.

`npm run svgSprite` - make icons file from svg sprites

Good hacking!
